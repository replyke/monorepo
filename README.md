Replyke gives developers a complete foundation for building social experiences - comments, votes, notifications, feeds, and more - without reinventing the wheel. Instead of wiring together a mix of libraries or building from scratch, Replyke offers drop-in APIs, SDKs, and components that are production-ready out of the box.

Built with a headless, TypeScript-first architecture, Replyke fits seamlessly into your stack. Whether you’re building a full social network or just need user comments on a blog post - Replyke has you covered.
