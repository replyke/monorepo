## Key Features

- **Comment system** - threaded replies, markdown, mentions, votes, moderation hooks
- **Feeds** - filter by tags, following or geography with hot, top or new sorting
- **In‑app notifications** - configurable events for votes, mentions, follows and more
- **Curated lists** - user folders and nested collections of entities
- **Follow graph** - one‑way follow relationships ready for social graphs
- **Admin tools** - reporting, suspensions, reputation and audit logs built in

All features come with backend APIs, typed SDKs and ready to use React and React Native components.

## Why Replyke

- **Save months of work** - plug in battle‑tested social primitives instead of reinventing them
- **Headless first** - bring your own auth and UI or use the included components
- **Full TypeScript stack** - the same types flow from database to client hooks
- **Self host (DIY) or cloud** - open‑source core plus an optional managed service for zero ops
