    In production:
    - NEVER expose your secret key in client-side code.
    - Refer to the documentation at https://docs.replyke.com to implement JWT signing on your backend.
    - Rotate your secret key periodically, especially after moving from testing to production.

    Failure to follow these practices can lead to security vulnerabilities.
