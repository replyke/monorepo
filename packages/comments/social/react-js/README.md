- **Highlighted Comments** – Pass a comment or reply ID to highlight it, useful for directing users from notifications.
- **GIF Support** – Enable GIFs in comments by adding your API key in the Replyke dashboard.
- **Built-in Authorization** – Ensures only authorized users can delete their own comments and prevents duplicate likes.
- **Reporting & Moderation** – Includes a reporting system with a moderation dashboard where project owners can review reports, remove content, and ban users.
